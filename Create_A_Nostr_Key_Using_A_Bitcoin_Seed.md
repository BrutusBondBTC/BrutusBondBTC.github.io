This is an experimental Blog Post.

**This is a Video Tutorial**


## I Posted The Video on Keet.

**It takes some time to get used to**, but it's **easier than signing up for a social media account**.

To view it, you will need [Keet](https://keet.io/).

Copy and paste this to the room in your keet for desktop or mobile app for access:

You can also find it on Youtube, but I want to share the videos I create using censorship resistant p2p software.

PeerTube is nice and I set it it up, but it takes too much memory.

Youtube is convinient.

The problem with YouTube is that **if some government sends a letter to Alphabet(A.K.A. Google)** that says, "The 1st Amendment is illegal in our jurisdiction, so please ban this video," **Alphabet(A.K.A. Google) bans the video**.

### Keet Reverses The Sovereignty. 

A sovereign nation can tell me to take down the video.

After all, the sovereign nation also has the right to speak freely.

The difference is that if I disagree, or just don't give a damn what some other nation thinks about the 1st Amendment, I do not need to take down the video.

Other sovereign individuals are free to share this video in their own Keet rooms.  They can add it to BitTorrent too. (Please do)

They are free to add it on their own keet chat rooms if they wish to do so.

Thank you for reading. 


**If you find this video valuable, you can send time talent or treasure back to me  or  Super Phat Arrow who wrote the code**.(an example of valuable talent he was so gracious to send to me.  Thank you Super Phat Arrow!)
