## Rough Draft of Paywalls Suck



I thought paywalls were an awesome way to get paid for writing. You write. You give your audience a little taste of your crack rock writing skills and BAM! They are addicted to your article, but the rest of it is locked behind a paywall. A bitcoin paywall, but still, a paywall. So they pay you 50 cents worth of sats like you asked.

I'm old enouph to remember when Newspapers used the analog subscription model. My dad paid for a.subscription to the local newspaper. For twenty-five 90's bucks a month the newspaper used child labor to throw bundles of black and white dead trees in his yard. It was an awesome deal because the newspaper also got paid via ads. They had cheap, child labor delivery and kept costs low because they really made more money if there was more eyeballs watching ads and more scissors clipping coupons.  

The Internet killed the newspapers and forced millions of bike peddling kids to enjoy their childhood. So they got rid of the dead trees. You might find one here or there, but the newspaper is an endangered species.

So they invinted the paywall. Pay the troll. Read the ads that Google bombards you with all day.  Little Timmy can sleep in because they will deliver it right to your spam box every morning. 

You get 5 articles for free, but after that you must pay. The newspapers took their business model from drug dealers, but they are not selling crack. They sell information.

The problem is that information wants to be free. The cost of information replication is now basically zero and anyone smart enouph to play minecraft can circumvent the paywalls.

Therefore, we must accept our new reality. I like the[value 4 value model](https://fountain.fm/episode/11615473908). The idea is to aknowedge that information longs to be free.

* Write quality content to the best of your ability.
* Share the content free of charge.
* Ask your audience, "If you find this blog post  valuable, please consider providing value in return in the form of 
* Time(Share with your followers)
* Talent(Can you create photos or write code that can make this article better?)
* Treasure(Send sats according to how valuable you found this article)

I came up with something I call a reverse paywall. The idea is to share the article, but instead of prompting your reader to pay a lightning invoice before he or she reads it, I would just put a button at the end. Ghost makes this easy witg [snippets](https://ghost.org/tutorials/code-snippets-in-ghost/). You can create a button that links to a BTCpayServer or LnBits tipping extension, although it is a mistake to think of this as a.tip(a mistake I have made many times by the way)  It's a value exchange, not a tip.

todo: add V4V button video.

This way, your content remains Free99 for and can help promote bitcoin to the masses. It can also help get more eyeballs on the content if people exchane a little time by sharing the article. Remember, black & white newspapers were unfairly cheap because more eyeballs = more revenue.

If people exchange the value of talent, your blog can be  even better. Adam Curry posts audience created artwork on his podcast and sends 10% of the treasure  for that show to the artist. Notice how thid value 4 value model is a two way street.

Then, at the end of the article, you leave a value 4 value button which asks for treasure. Theoretically, you could use Venmo or Patreon or even have your audience send gold to your PO BOX, but that's a pain in the ass.

We want to show the world that sats are the best way to exchange value that has ever been created. Therefore, we ask for the best trasure ever. 

We want sats to be the standard.
