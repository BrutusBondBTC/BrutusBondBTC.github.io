# I Forked Myself

Hello world! After listening to the value 4 value episode on Bitcoin Review, I decided my blog needed some changes. I am currently writing it on Ghost. It's the same platform Marty Bent Uses to write his newsletter.  I started using ghost because:

- It looks nice
- It's easy
- Marty's Bent has paywalls

I always thought it would be cool to make a living as a writer.  I wanted to write the great American novel like Hemingway.  I wanted to challenge and change free speech laws like Henry Miller. I thought it would be cool to write blogposts that hundreds of thousands of people would pay for with a paywall.  Of course, the chances of this happening are about 0.00000001% and that might be too optimistic. 

For one thing, **I don't write as well as Earnest Hemingway or Henry Miller**. Besides, most blog guides suggest to write at a sixth grade level. You should never use polysyllabic words. You must write to a broad audience that uses Google to track every thought they have ever had for the last 20 years.

I am also having some **difficult**y adjustments **changing the DNS settings** on my Yunohost virtual private server. For some reason, my changes only appear for about 24 hours and then the URL loses the connection the my IP address. This is bad for search engine optimization reasons. Search Engine Optimization is not my forte, but then again, why do I need it?

## Fork it!

Why do I need a website with a URL, IP address and virtual private server?  Why can't I write my blog in Markdown on a censorship resistant protocol instead? 

I have also changed my mind on paywalls after listening to [NVK's Value 4 Value podcast](https://fountain.fm/episode/12616447623).  This is not to criticize Marty. You should pay his paywall, because he is an awesome dude. I want to try this value 4 value model though.  That means I need to write something of value.  To do this, I can't write into the void on the Internet. I need to interact with plebs to see what is valuable to them.

What would you find valuable?  Do you need help using 
Robosats, a BTC Pay Server on clearnet,  or creating a NIP05 Identifier on github? Let me know.  I started this blog becuase I want to help contribute to the community.
